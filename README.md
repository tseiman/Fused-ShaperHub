# Fused ShaperHub

Shaper Hub provides a cloud based provate and public file repository - mainly for SVG files to be processed by the Shaper Origin (https://www.shapertools.com/).
Typically those SVG files are generated by e.g. Inkscape, Fusion 360 (exported by Shaper Origin Plugin) or similar. 
Those files need to be transfered from local PC to the Shaper Origin Machine - or uploaded (manually) to the Shaper Hub so it can be received by the Shaper Origin router.
This project intends to make ShaperHub locally via FUSE Fileystem mountable.
